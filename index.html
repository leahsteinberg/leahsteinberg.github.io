It was suggested that we make link shorteners (think bit.ly). We started talking about it. Turns out, there isn't an advanced hashing algorithm involved, like I had assumed there was. My general understanding is that when you give them a long url, they give you a random string, and they save those two together in a database. When you visit your shortened link, they search their database for that short link, and redirect you to its respective long link. </p>
<p>I was underwhelmed. Since their algorithm wasn't that smart, we decided to make ours even goofier. If you head over to <a href="lil-dino.com">lil-dino.com</a>, the world's first dinosaur-themed link shortener, you can give us your unwieldly, uncouth lengthy url. We'll take it, locate a scientifically-valid dinosaur suffix, scrape the page you gave us for an appropriate key word and concatenate the two. For example: www.hackerschool.com becomes lil-dino.com/hackernosaurus. Which, obviously, is longer, but whatever. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/pgayane/tinydino">code</a> and <a href="http://www.lil-dino.com/">here is the website</a>. I am as desperate as I've always been for a dinosaur illustration.</p>            </article>
